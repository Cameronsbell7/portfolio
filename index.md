# Keeping It Real: Cali Edition
#### Hey all! Welcome to my website! Started from the bottom at the coding world and now at the top!! No, I'm just joshing (which is quite hilarious seeing that my instructor's name is Josh). Anyways, my name is Cameron Bell, and I am an incoming freshman attending the Tuskegee University this Fall. An average summer for me consists of your typical 8am-11pm job shifts, 2 family vacations, and driving around the beautiful and busy city of Atlanta doing absolutely everything and nothing at the same time. However, this summer has been anything but average for me. 

#### It's been quite different than what I am used to. For starters, I am not in the ATL, but instead Cali, Northern California to be exact. Before I committed to Tuskegee University, I was presented with the opportunity to partake in a summer program in Cali at UC Berkeley. I know what you're thinking. Summer school? But hear me out. It was - or rather is - an all expense paid trip to study my respective major of Computer Science all while getting paid to take the class! Getting paid to take classes is a literal dream and one of the best opportunities one could posisbly have - especially as a freshemn.


#### Anyways, zoom past several months and it's time for me to go Cali. The day preparing to leave was quite memorable seeing as the morning I ate breakfast in North Carolina, had lunch in Atlanta, and ate a $20 wing combo in California (which is the most I have ever spent on fast food). The very next day was a holiday and after that, it was time to get to work. Within the first week, our TU cohort did a lot to say the least. We had a reception dinner at the Chancellor of UC Berkeley's mansion and met both the President of Tuskegee University and the Chancellor of UC Berkeley. A couple of days later, we visited Google's Headquarters in Mountain View California, which was such an amazing experience.
