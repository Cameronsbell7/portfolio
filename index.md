# Keeping It Real Edition: Cali Edition
##### Hey all! Welcome to my website! I know what you're thinking. Started from the bottom at the coding world and now at the top!! No, I'm just joshing (which is quite hilarious seeing that my instructor's name is Josh). Anyways, my name is Cameron Bell, and I am an incoming freshman attending the Tuskegee University this Fall. An average summer for me consists of your typical 8am-11pm job shifts, 2 family vacations, and driving around the beautiful and busy city of Atlanta doing absolutely everything and nothing at the same time. However, this summer has been anything but average for me. 

##### It's been quite different than what I am used to. For starters, I am not in the ATL, but instead Cali, Northern California to be exact. Before I committed to Tuskegee University, I was presented with the opportunity to partake in a summer program in Cali at UC Berkeley. I know what you're thinking? Summer school? But hear me out. It was - or rather is - an all expense paid trip to study my respective major of Computer Science all while getting paid to take the class! Getting paid to take classes is a literal dream and one of the best opportunities one could posisbly have - especially as a freshemn student. 


###### Anyways, zoom past a
_when there are millions and millions of students paying for their education whereas I am getting paid for my education._
