# Keeping It Real: Cali Edition
#### Hey all! Welcome to my website! Started from the bottom at the coding world and now at the top!! No, I'm just joshing (which is quite hilarious seeing that my instructor's name is Josh). Anyways, my name is Cameron Bell, and I am an incoming freshman attending the Tuskegee University this Fall. An average summer for me consists of your typical 8am-11pm job shifts, 2 family vacations, and driving around the beautiful and busy city of Atlanta doing absolutely everything and nothing at the same time. However, this summer has been anything but average for me. 

#### It's been quite different than what I am used to. For starters, I am not in the ATL, but instead Cali, Northern California to be exact. Before I committed to Tuskegee University, I was presented with the opportunity to partake in a summer program in Cali at UC Berkeley. I know what you're thinking. Summer school? But hear me out. It was - or rather is - an all expense paid trip to study my respective major of Computer Science all while getting paid to take the class! Getting paid to take classes is a literal dream and one of the best opportunities one could posisbly have - especially as a freshemn.


#### Anyways, zoom past several months and it's time for me to go Cali. The day preparing to leave was quite memorable seeing as the morning I ate breakfast in North Carolina, had lunch in Atlanta, and ate a $20 wing combo in California (which is the most I have ever spent on fast food). The very next day was a holiday and after that, it was time to get to work. Within the first week, our TU cohort did a lot to say the least. We had a reception dinner at the Chancellor of UC Berkeley's mansion and met both the President of Tuskegee University and the Chancellor of UC Berkeley. A couple of days later, we visited Google's Headquarters in Mountain View California, which was such an amazing experience. I could genuinely see myself working there one day and maybe even starting a company just as successful and innovative as Google. 


#### Skip past a couple of weeks and the official course begins. At first, it wasn't too difficult considering the two previous weeks we attended a coding bootcamp to prepare ourselves for the course. However, as the course progressed, it started to become a tad bit more difficult. Not necccesarily the content, but rather the pace in which the content was being presented and delivered. It seemed as if we were learning a new aspect of the coding world everyday. Despite the pace, I was determined to learn the content and understand the content considering this is the field I aspire to major in and make a career out of. 


#### Asides from the quick pace of the course and freezing cold weather that comes with being a Cal student, I have had a memorable summer. I've met and got to spend quality family time with my mom's side of the family, which I desperately needed and gave me a sense of home. I have stood over the Golden Gate Bridge. I went to Stinson Beach and the Muir Woods, which had the prettiest views of nature ever (gotta love Cali's scenery). I visited Pier 39 with my cousins and went to one of the best ice creams spots ever - shoutout to Cream. I saw the fireworks from Coit Tower. Not to mention, I went down the curviest street in the world! 


#### Not to brag, but you've just read an article or blog or whatever you want to call it from a celebrity. That's right, a celebrity. I have not one, but two articles with my face - along with the 12 other Tuskegee University students - on the FRONT page of BOTH Tuskegee University and UC Berkeley's webiste. If you'd like to learn more about the program and partnerships between the two prominent institutions, a link of the article on both websites are attached below! Thanks for reading about my experience in Cali and I hope to write one soon regarding my TU experience. For all my TU current students and proud alumni, TU!! YOU KNOW!!
