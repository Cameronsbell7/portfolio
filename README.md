# Keeping It Real: Cali Edition 
### Hey all! Welcome to my website! I know what you're thinking. Started from the bottom at the coding world and now at the top!! No, I'm just joshing (which is quite hilarious seeing that my instructor's name is Josh). Anyways, my name is Cameron Bell, and I am an incoming freshman attending the Tuskegee University this Fall. An average summer for me consists of your typical 8am-11pm job shifts, 2 family vacations, and driving around the beautiful and busy city of Atlanta. However, this summer has been anything but average for me. It's been quite different than what I am used to. For starters, I am not in the ATL, but instead Cali, Northern California to be exact.
